# birbTrain

For @sableRaph's weekly Creative Coding Challenge. The Challenge topic was 'Trains'.

Well this did not run on time. In theory you're driving a train around a lovely little town that looks like a mondrian painting picking up birb passengers. That's cute and fun. In reality god knows what you're looking at.

# Blender Bit.
- I know trains do not look like this.
- Just imagine a world where they could.
- I know birds do not look like this.
- Just imagine a world where they could.
- Now please make the sound you imagine they'd make.
- Yes, do the train noise as well.


# Three Bit + cannon bit.
- Three with Cannon for the physics.
- Made the train move like a car.
- Trains are just cars that are stuck in their ways basically.
- Yeah, I dont believe that either but needed an excuse.
- Had a whole nightmare where scaling the model seemed to break the positions of everything and so the three bits wouldnt match the cannon bits.
- Took so long to figure that out that nothing else works.


# Shader bit.
- There is no shader bit.
- This is due to everything else going wrong.


# Other bit.
- Click the title for dark mode.
